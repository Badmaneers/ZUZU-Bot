You are capable of amazing things. Just believe in yourself!
Slay today like it’s a fashion runway!
Your only limit is your mind—think big, act bold!
Be your own biggest cheerleader. The world will catch up.
Don't stop until you're proud!
Great things take time, so stay consistent and keep going!
Turn your can'ts into cans and your dreams into plans!
The struggle you're facing today is building the strength you need tomorrow.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you!
Success starts with self-discipline. Get up, stay motivated, and hustle!
Babe, you didn’t wake up today to be average. Go SLAY. 
Confidence level: Selfie with no filter! Own it!
You are not just a snack, you're the whole damn buffet!
If at first you don’t succeed, fix your eyeliner and try again.
You got this, queen! Just like WiFi, keep searching for that connection.
Even Google can’t find someone like you! Stay unique!
Slay today like it’s a fashion runway, darling!
If life gives you lemons, throw them back and demand coffee.
No one is you, and that’s your power! 💅
You weren’t born to fit in; you were born to stand out!
