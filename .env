# AI Configuration

# Note: The AI_MODEL specifies which AI model to use for generating responses. Adjust it based on your needs and the models available in your OpenRouter account.
AI_MODEL=""
# Note: The AI_TEMPERATURE parameter controls the creativity of the AI's responses. A higher value (closer to 1) will make the output more creative and random, while a lower value will make it more focused and deterministic. Adjust it based on your needs. 
AI_TEMPERATURE=
# Note: The AI_TOP_P parameter controls the diversity of the AI's responses. A higher value (closer to 1) will make the output more diverse, while a lower value will make it more focused and deterministic. Adjust it based on your needs.
AI_TOP_P=
# Note: The AI_MAX_RETRIES defines how many times the bot will retry an AI request in case of failure. Adjust it based on your needs and server capacity.
AI_MAX_RETRIES=
# Note: The MEMORY_LIMIT defines the maximum number of memory entries the bot can store. Adjust it based on your needs and server capacity.

# Memory Security

# Note: The MEMORY_ACCESS_PASSWORD is used to protect access to the bot's memory data. Change it to something secure to prevent unauthorized access.
MEMORY_ACCESS_PASSWORD=""
# Note: The MEMORY_ENCRYPTION_KEY is used to encrypt the bot's memory data stored in the database. It should be a 32-byte base64-encoded string. You can generate a secure key using the following Python code:
# from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# key = Fernet.generate_key()
# print(key.decode())
